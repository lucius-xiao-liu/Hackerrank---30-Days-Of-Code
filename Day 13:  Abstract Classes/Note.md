# Abstract Class

### Abstraction
* essential feature of *object-oriented* programming
* separation between a class doing and  how it is accomplished
* getting the object *without* knowing how the internals are designed (implemented details)

### Abstract Class
* can have Abstract methods + defined (non-abstract) methods
* must create and instantiate a subclass extended the abstract class
* abstract methods must be  implementated by its subclasses
