# Interface
* A collection of abstract **methods**
* Template of functionality that want the classes to have within abstract methods
    * No Implementations
    * No Constructors
    * No Instance
* A **Class MUST implement** the  interface and define what's going to do
* A static property cannot be **CHANGED** inside an interface


### Coding use
* After create an interface:
* create a class
* public class ClassName implements Interface {
  Inside methods needs to be matched
  &
  Must implemented all of the methods in Interface
}

* The only way to use an interface is to create a class that implements that interface


* **Implement** an Interface
* **Extend** a class
